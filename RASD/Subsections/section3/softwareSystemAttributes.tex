Sofware System Attributes (also called \textit{Non Functional Requirements}) describe how the system works and allow us to judge system's doing as it receives an high quantity of requests and its performance gets tested under such circumstances.

\subsubsection{Reliability}
	The system has a 99.9/100 percent reliability since the only problems that could create system anomalies are those related to server management; payments and eventual interactions with sharing services are managed by their corresponding companies.

\subsubsection{Availability}
	The system must be active 24/7 and servers are allowed to be out of service exclusively for system updates and the likes, possibly after a  warning to the users.

\subsubsection{Security}
	Users' credentials are stored and managed in according to privacy laws, so the user is safe from malicious agents.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
	In order to provide a perfect service, constant maintenance on the system is required. The application is updated every 14 days (except for urgent cases) with an average out-of-service time of 8 minutes thanks to the work of a senior engineer and three junior engineers.

\subsubsection{Portability}
	The scope of this software is confined to the environment of mobile applications. Preferences transfer is allowed through the insert of user credentials so data like events, locations and personalized timetables can be exported and saved on the \textit{Travlendar+} server.
