We now adopt a goal-based approach to determine the requirements associated with each one of the goals we have elaborated in Chapter 1.

We'll start numbering and exploring the goals we submitted.

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item \textit{[G1]}System provides an authentication system.

			\item [R.5.7] Favourite travel means associated to an appointment must always show up.
			\item [R.5.8] In case two or more appointments overlap, an appointment with higher priority is considered automatically chosen and all the remaining ones are arranged according to their priority. Warnings must follow as expected.

			\item [R.6.2] The application must arrange a navigable interface of feasible solutions.
			\item [R.6.3] Choosing a solution that includes a public transportation mean must show the user the possibility to buy a ticket.
			\item [R.6.4] Choosing a solution that includes a shared vehicle must show the user the possibility to locate and rent such a vehicle.
			\item [R.6.5] Choosing a solution must not be definitive.
			\item [R.6.6] System must recognize by itself through geolocalization that a user reached destination; also, User must always be able to stop the trip.
		\end{itemize}
                  
                  
	\item \textit{[G7]} The application warns the user if locations are unreachable in the allotted time.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[R.7.1] The application must realize if the alloted time is sufficient from either the last event, current location or manually inserted location.
