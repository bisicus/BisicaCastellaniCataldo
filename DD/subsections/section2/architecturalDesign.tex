\subsection{Overview}

	As we anticipated, in this section we’re goint to give an array of views of our system, shaping it from many angles at once. We’ll detail both the high-level components and the interfaces interleaved among them, delving then into deployment and runtime view.
	[Check] The architectural style we chose to adopt is a three-layered one.
	The decision to implement an external DB was born because of the need of providing a realiable and safe synchronization tool for our users and to store other kinds of personal information submitted through the app (like preferences and the like).
	Since the client implements travel logic and actually consists in the mobile application we’re aiming to develop, we are without any doubt in the frame of a fat client design.
