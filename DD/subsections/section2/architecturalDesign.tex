\subsection{Overview}

	As we anticipated, in this section we’re going to give an array of views of our system, shaping it from many angles at once. We’ll detail both the high-level components and the interfaces interleaved among them, delving then into deployment and runtime view.
	The architectural style we chose to adopt is a three-layered one.
	The decision to implement an external DB was born out of the need to provide a realiable and safe synchronization tool for our users and to store other kinds of personal information submitted through the app (like preferences and the like).
