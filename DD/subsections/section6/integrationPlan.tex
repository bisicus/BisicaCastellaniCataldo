\subsubsection{Entry Criteria}
	In order to start a correct integration test we must ensure the following conditions are granted:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requirements Analysis and Specification Document as well as the Design Document must be complete in each section and up to date, reflecting the current state of the project
		\item All sub-components must be already unit tested and bug free
		\item Risk Assessment has been layed out since it'll serve us in critical-first module integration
	\end{itemize}

	In addition to this we assume that all algorithms that interface external agents and make use of APIs will be already tested and that they will work as intended in receiving external data when proceeding with integration (we're talking about all sub-components that contain the word 'API' in API Manager component).


\subsubsection{Elements to be integrated}
	All components we created and delimited in components diagram are going to be integrated. All components that give the chance to do so, will also be tested regarding the integration of the single subcomponents.

\subsubsection{Integration Testing Strategy}
	The integration of the system will be guided by a bottom-up approach. This strictly comes from an analysis of the dependency structure of the components diagram provided in the DD, restructured in Figure \ref{DependencyTreehighLevel} and Figure \ref{DependencyTreeComplete} to better highlight the key modules and their connections.

	\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Sequence of component integration}
	From a component perspective we can safely say we adopted a bottom-up policy for the integration plan, while we also used a critical-first approach in sub-components integration (requiring, therefore, stubs in such cases). 
	Our choice has mainly been driven by its ease and by the relatively small scale of our system.
	
	Sequence of component/function integration.
	It's time for us to detail the integration order of our components, delving in what we simply anticipated with our dependency diagrams.

\subsubsection{Subsystem integration sequence}
	The integration of the macro-components is performed, as said, in a bottom-up fashion. Below are the 6 steps in which this process has been divided for scheduling reasons.
	Inside a single step, multiple macro-components participate in the integration, each one relying on the macro-components in the previous levels.
