	\section{Introduction}
		\subsection{Purpose}
		
		This document is the \textit{Requirement Analysis and Specification Document} (from now on RASD) for the information system \textit{Travelandar+}.
		This application aims to help users in their everyday life by organizing their appointments and optimizing their travel means.
		No previous versions of this application have been developed. 
		We’ll start by describing Stakeholders’ aims (Goals), from which we obtain, subsequently, functional and nonfunctional requirements (\textit{Requirements} Section) useful to describe the system.
		In addition we will need two other sections to have a complete overview of the model: \textit{Constraints} Section is going to describe constraints about the system, while \textit{Domain Properties} Section is going to underline the limits forced by the world on our software.
		We'll analyze this first chapter to subsequently delve into scenarios and use cases for the application.

		\subsection{Scope}
		The aim of this project is to develop \textit{Travlendar+}, a calendar-based mobile application. 
		The main functionality of the system is helping people in scheduling their appointments by taking into account useful, external information regarding traffic, public transportation, weather, and the like. 
		Appointments could be scheduled through the entire region of Lombardy (Italy), and the main Italian cities connected via railway system. There could be several types of work meetings and personal appointments.
		Furthermore the system can help the user by allowing the purchase of public transportation tickets via the mobile application itself, or by reserving a car or a bike of a sharing system (whenever this is possible). In case of bad weather the system should find alternative moving solutions in order to replace walking paths, same goes with strikes and other relevant kinds of information. 
		Naturally, the system will also allow the registration of new users; as for the registration, the system requests both personal and payment information. After the registration succeeds, the user could immediately start scheduling his meetings.

		\subsection{Used tools}
		For this assignment, we used the following tools:
		
		\begin{description}
			\item [Alloy] We used the alloy tool to write the code and check the models for the specification.
			\item [LaTeX] The group used LaTeX to structure the final document and to help with versioning.
			\item [Github] We leaned on Github for versioning and coordinating synchronized work.
