\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies, constraints}

	We've already given a formal and methodical definition of our problem, yet there are still some ambiguities which still need to be addresed.


		\begin{enumerate}
		
			\item Users do not create events outside the “operative zone”

			\item The devices Travlendar+ is installed on possess a well-functioning GPS for geo-localization

			\item If a registered User is willing to use the vehicle of a sharing network, we assume him to have downloaded the corresponding sharing-network app

			\item There’s no kind of dependency among the users of our system

			\item Any information coming from sharing services regarding position, rental, and payment won’t be double-checked by our system

			\item Information coming from external payment sites won’t be double checked by our system

			\item Buying public transportation tickets rely on the aforementioned external payment procedures

			\item System assumes the season passes submitted by the user only aid for filtering results and are not checked nor have any legal value

			\item System assumes that any car rental request is made by a person who’s allowed to make one. Only sharing services check the validity of documents; in addition to that we always assume the driver is the user who requests the rental

			
		\end{enumerate}
