SCENARIO 2:

David is 17 years old and has recently joined the soccer team of his city. 
His coach has fixed that training sessions will be held every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 18:00. 
Then David opens Travelandar+ and puts his commitments until the end of the season. 
The application suggests that the fastest way to go to the field training is the subway, so David decides to buy a season pass so that he can safely go to training sessions without having to ask his parents.
After buying season pass he registered it on the application.
