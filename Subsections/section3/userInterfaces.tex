The interface of our System is thought to be used via mobile app, because all the functionality make sense only in a \textit{movable} context (meaning, such that the user can do them anywhere they have an internet connection).

We will now list some of the user interfaces thought for \textit{Travlendar+}":

% login %
\begin{SCfigure}[2.5][h]
	\caption{Login Page. \\
		As mentioned before, a \textit{Guest} or a \textit{non logged User} will encounter page showed in figure, and he will never enter into the app until he completes the Login procedure (see section \ref{register_para}).}
