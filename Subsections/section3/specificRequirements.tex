\subsection{Design Constraints}
		\begin{description}
			\item[Standards compliance]
			The system must require User’s location to work, so the application asks for it according to privacy laws the first time the user runs the application.
			The payment system is guaranteed by the corresponding external application, so Travlendar+ doesn’t ask users for their credit card number.

			\item[Hardware limitations]
			Mobile app:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Space for app package
			\item 3G connection or better
			\item GPS
