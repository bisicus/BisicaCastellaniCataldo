\subsection{Functional Requirements}

We now adopt a goal-based approach to determine the requirements associated with each one of the goals we have elaborated in Chapter 1.\\
We'll start numbering and exploring the goals we submitted.

\begin{itemize}

            \item \textit{[G1]} System allows guest user to register with an username ad and a password; to complete the procedure user should confirm by

                        \item [R.1.5] An unregistered user is locked out the application and can only see registration page
                        \item [R.1.6] User has to confirm by mail his registration
                  \end{itemize}

 \begin{itemize}
                        \item [R.3.1] User has to be registered and logged in the system in order to create an
appointment
                        \item [R.3.2] Appointments can be divided into work appointments (or meetings) and personal appointments
                        \item [R.3.3] Appointments require a location and a starting time and an end time
                        \item [R.3.4] Appointments location must be within the boundaries of the operative zone
                        \item [R.3.5] The chosen location can be within the boundaries of the influence zone
                        \item [R.3.5] There cannot be appointments with the same name, location and time
                        \item [R.3.6] Based on already existing appointments, system checks suitability of created new entries
                        \item [R.3.7] Appointment start time can't precede the actual system time at the moment of inserting it                        
                  \end{itemize}

                       \item  [R.4.1] A modified meeting must respect all the constraint imposed during the creation of a new meeting, as in [G3]
                       \item [R.4.2] A meeting can be modified up until its end time
                       \item [R.4.3] If the location of the meeting is modified it gets 
                       \item [R.4.4] If the location of the meeting is modified system behaves as if such an event was inserted for the first time, calculating all possibile conflicts with pre-existing events
                       \item [R.5.5] No limit actually exists on the amount of times an event can be modified
                       \item [R.5.6] 
                     


                  \end{itemize}

\item \textit{[G5]} The application can automatically compute a personalized selection of travel times between appointments to choose from

                  \begin{itemize}
                        \item [R.5.1] System verifies the travel mean is feasible for the submitted appointments
                        \item [R.5.2] According to the type of appointment, the system submits the data to corresponding external services
                        \item [R.5.3] Based on meeting type and time of day system ranks all the solutions
                        \item [R.5.4] Time is calculated by imposing a start position submitted by the user as specificied in [G12]
                  \end{itemize}
                  
\item \textit{[G6]} User can choose a preferred solution among the best ones

                        \item [R.6.3] 
                  \end{itemize}
                  
\item \textit{[G7]} The application warns the user if locations are unreachable in the allotted time 

\item \textit{[G8]} Allow users to put constraints on different travel means and limit carbon footprints

\item \textit{[G9]} The application features additional user’s privileged time spans 

\item \textit{[G10]} The application allows to arrange the trips : tickets for public services

\item \textit{[G11]} The application allows the nearest shared vehicle to be found and reserved

                   \begin{itemize}
                        \item [R.11.1] A shared vehicle belongs to a bike-sharing service or a car-sharing service
                        \item [R.12.2] All services linked to shared vehicles are automatically disabled if the location of a meeting out of the boundaries of the influence zone
                        \item [R.12.3] All sharing services have their own API and they must be referenced by our mobile application
                        \item [R.12.4] To find or reserve a vehicle it is required by our system the access to the external API of the required service
                        \item [R.12.5] To find or reserve a vehicle it's required that the user logins into the external corresponding service
                        \item [R.12.6] The external service can communicate with our mobile application. In case of reservation Travlendar+ checks if the mobile app corresponding to the desired services is installed on the system. All the following steps take place within such an environment, until control is returned to Travlendar+
                        \item [R.12.7] The location of all the vehicles are shown in the same view, merging data from different APIs
                        \item [R.12.8] The renting happens

                        \item [R.12.2] The mobile device can track its current position through geo-localization
                        \item [R.12.3] Position of out the operative zone won't be accepted by the system
                   \end{itemize}


\item \textit{[G13]} EVENTUAL NAVIGATION
