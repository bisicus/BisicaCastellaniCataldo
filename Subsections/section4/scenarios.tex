\subsection{Scenario "2"}

David is 17 years old and has recently joined the soccer team of his city. His coach has fixed that training sessions will be held every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 18:00. Then David opens Travelandar+ and puts his commitments until the end of the season. The application suggests that the fastest way to go to the field training is the subway, so David decides to buy a season pass so that he can safely go to training sessions without having to ask his parents.\\
After buying season pass he registered it on the application.

\subsection{Scenario "3"}

Elizabeth loves dedicating the right amount of time to her appointments, from work to family to her hobbies. Recently though she’s having a hard time conciling all of her commitments. That’s why her friend Alex recommends her to use the Travelandar + application : Elizabeth follows his advice and downloads the application on her smartphone. It’s only half an hour and Elisabetta is very satisfied, especially because she could set up an "Optimal Lunch" function that allows her to devote the right amount of time to her lunch, denying the opportunity to add appointments around the 30 minutes of lunch.

\subsection{Scenario "8"}

Tom is a bank employee working in Bologna. He decided to return at home in Milan next Friday to celebrate his father's birthday together with his family. Because of this he opens Travlendar+ on his smartphone and creates a "Dad's party" event for Friday night. Tom’s job does not allow him to leave Bologna before 18.00. Fortunately Travlendar+ also allows him to find travel solutions by cross-region trains as well as by car. In fact, it all comes down to Tom's choice. He proceeds to buy train tickets : to him Friday isn’t coming fast enough!
